The Mark Brooks Calnon Collection consists of estate materials from 2nd. Lt.
Mark Brooks Calnon, including memorabilia relating to his experiences in World
War II as a pilot and prisoner of war.  The collection includes photographs,
documents, an oral history (audio/video/transcript), and a copy of Calnon's
book, Some Lived, Some Died It Was Understood. The collection was put together
by Journalism and Mass Media Professor Denise Bennett as part of a Seed Grant funded project.
