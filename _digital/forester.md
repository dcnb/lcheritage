The Idaho Forester was published annually from 1917 - 1997 by the University of Idaho's forestry program. The journal combines research articles, UI program activities information, and analysis of the forest products industry, formerly the dominant industry in Northern Idaho. The collection was developed with the support of a Project Ceres Grant from the Center for Research Libraries and the United States Agricultural Information Network.
