The Kooskia Internment Camp Scrapbook documents the sights, tasks, scenes, and events of Japanese men detained during the camp's two years or operation (May 1943 - May 1945). The camp was located in a remote area of north central Idaho, 30 miles from the town of Kooskia; it was administered by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for the U.S. Department of Justice.
