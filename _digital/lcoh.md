In the mid 1970s, the Latah County Historical Society collected over 300 oral histories from local Northern Idaho residents who grew up in Idaho during the early part of the 20th century. The Latah County Oral History Project produced one of the largest collections of oral histories in the Pacific Northwest. A copy of the transcripts and cassette recordings was donated to the University of Idaho Library in 1987. Those items were digitized and uploaded into our database in 2013.
