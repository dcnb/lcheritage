The Nez Perce Historical Portrait Collection includes nearly 600 photographs of individuals and groups from the Nez Perce/Nimíipuu tribe. Most photographs were taken during the first half of the 20th century. Much of the collection is comprised of studio photographs that have been taken of both individuals and families.
