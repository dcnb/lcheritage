The nine log books in this collection detail daily events from 1997 to 2010 recounted by those living and working at the Taylor Wilderness Research Station. In addition to describing the routine research and maintenance task, the logs also provide wildlife sightings and firsthand accounts of harrowing events, such as the dramatic forest fire and evacuation of the year 2000.
