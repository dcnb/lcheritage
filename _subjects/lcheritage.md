The Latah County Common Heritage Collection came about through the funding of an National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Common Heritage Grant awarded to the University of Idaho Library in 2016. The materials in this collection were collected via community digitization days held in Moscow and Potlatch in 2016 and 2017.
