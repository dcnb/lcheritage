The Chatcolab Northwest Leadership Laboratory has been running each summer since 1949. Chatcolab offers a unique opportunity to build leadership by engaging in the creative planning and then sharing of a recreational experience. This collection of packets was donated by Bob Carver to the University of Idaho Library and digitized by the digital initatives unit in 2017.
